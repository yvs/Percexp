# DotLattice Experiment data
# 

# There are four types of sections: SESSION, FIXED, VARYING and BLOCK
# Each section should start with the opening tag <NAME> and be concluded
# with the closing tag </NAME>
  
# 1. SESSION section holds the general session data

<SESSION>
paid no                 # whether the subject is paid

practiceTrials 5
demoTrials 5
sessionTrials auto      # if auto, the pram gets calculated as the length of the longest block sequence (see BLOCK section)

maskingRadius 100       # how far dots can jump during masking (in pixels)

# 2. FIXED section specifies the dot lattice data that do not change during the session
#    Note. Anything in the FIXED section will be overridden if also present in VARYING or BLOCK sections

#gamma 80

</FIXED>


# 3. VARYING section lets specify a generative procedure for the named parameter.
#    Generated data undergo necessary (re)permutations during the session run and will be supplied 
#    to the lattice for as long as needed.
#    Attributes for generation should be specified as given in the example below
#    Parameters:
#                parMin - minimum value for generation (inclusive)
#                parMax - maximum value for generation (inclusive)
#                    Note: For parameters gamma, theta, dotAngle both parMin and parMax 
#                          are already known to the software and can be omitted.
#                          parMin is also known for baAspect (1.0).
#                parStep - step size to cover the range from parMin to parMax
#                stepCount - number of steps to generate between parMin and parMax (including both)
#                    Note: stepCount and parStep are mutually exclusive
#                method - random or regular. If random is used then parMin, parMax and stepCount
#                    should also be specified. 
#                parTable - list of values to use for the parameter in the form (val1, val2, val3…)
#                    Note: if parTable is given all other attributes are ignored
#                shuffled - whether the generated set should undergo permutation(s). True by default.
#    Note. Anything in the VARYING section will be overridden if also present in any of BLOCK sections

<VARYING>
theta stepCount=10 shuffled=False 
</VARYING>

# 4. BLOCK sections define sequences of multi-parametric vectors to be used throughout the session.
#    The header has two attributes:
#        repeats - how many times the block set should be repeated. 1 by default
#        shuffled - if True, all instances of the block will be individually permuted and then mixed 
#                   thus removing the block boundaries. True by default.
#    The data within the block body has to specify first line as a semantic header.
#    All subsequent lines specify one data vector.
#
#    Note. There can be as many <BLOCK>…</BLOCK> sections as needed.
#          If the same parameter name is specified in more than one block, the last block data will prevail.
#    If sessionTrials parameter in SESSION section is set to auto, it will be set to the longest
#          block sequence calculated as blockseq_length * blockseq_repeats.
